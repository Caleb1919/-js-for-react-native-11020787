Task 1: Processing the Numbers Array
The first task involves transforming each number in an array based on its parity (even or odd). This transformation prepares numerical data for subsequent processing or analysis by applying specific rules to each element of the array.

Task 2: Formatting the Strings Array
The second task focuses on formatting an array of strings based on corresponding processed numbers. This ensures that textual data aligns with the transformed numerical data, facilitating cohesive data presentation and analysis.

Task 3: Creating User Profiles
The final task involves creating structured user profiles using original and modified strings. Each profile includes an identifier (id), the original string (originalName), and its formatted counterpart (modifiedName), facilitating organized data management and retrieval.
